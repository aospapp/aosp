 *
 * <p>Optionally, you can guarantee that these methods do not run outside of an additional user by
 * using {@code Devicestate}.
 *
 * <p>This requires the use of {@link com.android.bedstead.harrier.BedsteadJUnit4}. This will
 * replace this annotation with the {@code RequireRunOn} annotation for the additional user.
 *
 * <p>Note that in general this requires the test runs on a secondary user. On headless system user
 * devices, this will require running on a second secondary user.
 *
 * <p>This annotation by default opts a test into multi-user presubmit. New tests should also be
 * annotated {@link Postsubmit} until they are shown to meet the multi-user presubmit
 * requirements.
