"""Provides useful diff information for build artifacts.

This file is intended to be used like a Jupyter notebook. Since there isn't a
one-to-one pairing between Soong intermediate artifacts and Bazel intermediate
artifacts, I've found it's easiest to automate some of the diffing while
leaving room for manual selection of what targets/artifacts to compare.

In this file, the runnable sections are separated by the `# %%` identifier, and
a compatible editor should be able to run those code blocks independently. I
used VSCode during development, but this functionality also exists in other
editors via plugins.

There are some comments throughout to give an idea of how this notebook can be
used.
