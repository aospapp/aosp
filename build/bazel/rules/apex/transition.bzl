Configuration transitions for APEX rules.

Transitions are a Bazel mechanism to analyze/build dependencies in a different
configuration (i.e. options and flags). The APEX transition is applied from a
top level APEX rule to its dependencies via an outgoing edge, so that the
dependencies can be built specially for APEXes (vs the platform).

e.g. if an apex A depends on some target T, building T directly as a top level target
will use a different configuration from building T indirectly as a dependency of A. The
latter will contain APEX specific configuration settings that its rule or an aspect can
use to create different actions or providers for APEXes specifically..

The outgoing transitions are similar to ApexInfo propagation in Soong's
top-down ApexInfoMutator:
