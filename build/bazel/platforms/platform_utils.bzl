platform_utils.bzl defines a platform_utils rule, and several
utility functions that accept an instance of that rule and return
information about the target platform. One instance of the platform_utils
rule is defined in //build/bazel/platforms:platform_utils. All rules
that need it can depend on that target, and then call the util
functions by doing something like `is_target_linux(ctx.attr._platform_utils)`.
This works because child targets inherit their parent's configuration.
